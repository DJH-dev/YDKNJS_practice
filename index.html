  <p>
    When working in the browser a global variable (using let for the declaration) can shadow a global object property.
  </p>

  <p>
    consider the predefined global property name (window.name) its type is String and it returns a string, representing the name of the window.
  </p>
<code>
var name = 42;
console.log(typeof name, name); //string, 42

because we used var the global object property name has not been shadowed and there for still returns a string as suggested by the global property.

let name = 42
console.log(typeof name, name); //number 42

decalring a global variable with let will shadow a global object property so typeof name shows number.

see the console for code.
